        <p>On a surface level, "Those Who Walk Away from Omelas" appears to be a thinly veiled representation of our societies where the average person is not morally reticent enough to resist material comfort and turns a blind eye to the suffering existing in their society. The 'Ones who walk away,' on the otherhand, are the strong willed who refuse to be involved in the exploitative system. Upon further inspection, however, "Those Who Walk Away from Omelas" is criticizing <strong>both</strong> as selfish in nature--the ones who leave and those who stay are both incapable of acting in any way other than that which leaves them most comfortable.</p>
  	<p>Ethically, the problem in the story is quite simple: Omelas is an immoral structure and the happiness built on such a structure is no excuse. One could go so far as to say that treating others as equals is the single most axiomatic moral value that humans have. It should follow logically that those who decide to stay and remain complicit are choosing their own physical well being over their morallity. Following the exact same logic, those who decide their method of combatting such inequality is to leave the system are just as selfish--having decided that living complicitly would be too morally difficult, they seek to serve their best interests by giving up physical wellbeing for moral wellbeing. Notice, however, that neither does anything to reduce the suffering of the oppressed. In other words, <strong>their actions have no intention to fix the moral issue</strong>. The only distinguishing factor between the two is which they hold to be more important: their morals or their physical environment.</p>
