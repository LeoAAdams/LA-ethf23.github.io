<p>Malini Boorgu’s article “How AI Is Improving Accessibility” outlines some of the personal and societal benefits of various AI based tools aimed at assisting the neurodivergent. It specifically focuses on the usage of AI for improved learning, and tools to reduce stressors in the workplace. <strong>While the article provides an optimistic view of these tools (and not necessarily without reason), there are potentially problematic ideas present. Specifically, an over reliance on statistical models that are generally unreliable as a ‘primary source,’ and the commercialization of the neurodivergent.</strong></p>
<p>Using the most recent and most popular example, anyone who has played with ChatGPT has experienced its power, and has also probably experienced completely incorrect answers (which it produces quite convincingly). AI models seem to shine when used as a resource alongside more reliable resources simply due to the fact that they are a statistical model–they are excellent at compiling information and forming connections, but there is no guarantee that the information is correct. This can be mostly remedied through careful supervision and selection of training material, but this also brings in more biases and the original problem that occurs with a simple textbook. Returning focus to the article, it should be clear how a reliance on black box statistical models for learning is potentially worrying. On the other hand, creating connections useful for a neurodivergent brain sounds like something deep learning models would be excellent at–creating connections that our society has yet to understand. Also, despite the flaws in AI models, it is unclear that those flaws aren’t more present in the traditional learning environment with teachers and textbooks each with their own biases and misconceptions.</p>
<p>Heavily using unchecked AI for communication in the workplace should be criticized in the same manner. Unless someone is going over both the original and translated text (which sounds like more work than just sending the original message), there is no guarantee that the message received includes all the relevant information. Again, however, there are obvious benefits. Besides the obvious one of enabling the neurodivergent, this is an incredibly powerful tool if communication is so inefficient that messages can be significantly reduced/simplified without loss of information. In this case, Saleforce’s summarization tool should be used by everyone as it sounds like a simple upgrade. Making people think more about effective communication might be the single largest benefit of the tools.</p>
<p>Finally, the commercialization of the neurodivergent is debatably an ethical dilemma. To illustrate, “Companies also appreciate neurodivergent employees’ affinity for repetitive tasks, which can cause burnout in many neurotypical workers, and their loyalty to the company as they are less likely to leave for other opportunities”. Given that skill retention is a large incentive for the proper treatment of workers, it’s worrying that the neurodivergent are a group both less likely to leave as well as more fit to an environment others wouldn’t consider healthy. On the other hand, if this is truly an environment they thrive in, it is difficult to say how different this is from any other worker.</p>
